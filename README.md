Video notes to install harbor private registry on kubernetes

Harbor is open source and CNCF‑graduated project, which means it’s vendor‑neutral and battle‑tested by many organizations.​
It extends the basic “store image” registry with a full enterprise feature set on top of the OCI Distribution spec.

With Harbor you get user and group management, RBAC, project isolation, policy‑driven replication, notary‑based signing, and built‑in scanners like Trivy or Clair, which many basic registries simply don’t provide out of the box.
